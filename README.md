Project Euler Python 3.4 Solutions


SPOILER ALERT

These are my python solutions to Project Euler problems

Here is a list of my gaols in order.
<ol>
<li>Mathematical solutions that opperate in as few steps as possible, one step is preffered.</li>
<li>To use functions as often as possible so that I can reuse them in other solutions</li>
<li>To contribute these funcitons to my other repository Python_Functions.</li>
<li>Use VScode to run it. Import all from each problem, uncomment the desired problem. THere is an output time printed to the console.
</ol>
